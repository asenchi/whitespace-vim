# whitespace

This Vim theme is inspired by the Python logo and the Github theme.  Just a
color varition that I've used for about a month now. Decided I'd finish it up
and share it.

Right now it's directed more towards Python's syntax. I want to figure out how
to get this more universal across all langauges.
